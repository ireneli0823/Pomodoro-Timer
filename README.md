## 🤖 AI-Generated Content (AIGC)
### **This entire app was written by GPT AI.**
My contribution was exclusively **prompt engineering**, where I used **natural language** to guide GPT in generating:
- ✅ **SwiftUI UI Components**: Structuring layouts, implementing animations, and designing UI/UX.
- ✅ **Countdown Timer Logic**: Creating the core timer functionality with start, pause, and reset.
- ✅ **Dynamic UI Updates**: Ensuring smooth interactions, including blinking alerts and time formatting.
- ✅ **Debugging & Performance Optimization**: Fixing errors and optimizing for efficiency.
- ✅ **App Icon & Design Suggestions**: Generating a custom app icon with 🍅 on a warm yellow background.
- ✅ **README & Documentation**: Writing structured and professional documentation.

> **This project is a demonstration of how powerful AI can be in software development, with the user acting as a high-level orchestrator through prompt engineering.** 🚀
